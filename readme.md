BOUNCEBACK
--------------------------------

Bounceback is a old-school videogame about bouncing atoms and having to pay attention to too many things at the same time.

Bounceback is built in vanilla ES6 JavaScript using SVG graphics with a bit of React and MobX, just because.

And it's a hundred times better with headphones.

This game is built using Nik Nak Studio React + Webpack Starter Kit as starting point.
